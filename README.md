Ruby client for [competitive "What? Where? When?" (aka "CHGK") API](http://api.rating.chgk.net/). This gem is a replacement for [ChgkRating](https://github.com/bodrovis/ChgkRating) which worked only with the deprecated API version.

## Installation and requirements

This gem requires Ruby 2.7+. Install it by running:

```
$ gem install rating-chgk-v2
```

Include it in your script:

```ruby
require 'rating_chgk_v2'
```

## Client initialization

Initialize an API client:

```ruby
@client = RatingChgkV2.client
```

Optionally, provide your JWT token and connection options (please note that JWT is not required to access most of the endpoints):

```ruby
@client = RatingChgkV2.client token: 'MY_JWT', params: {open_timeout: 100, timeout: 500}
```

Now use client to perform API requests:

```ruby
teams = @client.teams itemsPerPage: 2, name: '–ù', page: 3
```

## Usage

**[Please find documentation at our Wiki](https://github.com/bodrovis/rating-chgk-v2/wiki)**.

## Running tests

Tests are written in RSpec (all HTTP requests are stubbed):

```
rspec .
```

Observe test results and coverage.
